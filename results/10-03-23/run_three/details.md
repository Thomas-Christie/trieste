Goal of Experiment - Visualise when we consider a constraint to be binding. This confirmed my
suspicion that the actual binding constraint is considered non-binding at the optimal point in later iterations, causing it not to be considered binding.

Used following parameters for continuous optimiser:
- `num_initial_samples=10000`
- `num_optimization_runs=100`

Used fixed z-value of 1.2816.
