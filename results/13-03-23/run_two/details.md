Goal of Experiment - Visualise how constraint is considered to be binding varies with different z-values.

Conclusion - Increasing z-values does increase area where constraints are considered to be binding. Still not clear if area around optimum point becomes isolated in later iterations.

Used following parameters for continuous optimiser:
- `num_initial_samples=10000`
- `num_optimization_runs=100`

Used fixed z-value of 1.2816.
